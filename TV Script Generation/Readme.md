# TV Script Generation
## Project Overview
This project is based on the TV Script Generation repo for the Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree.

It generates its own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs and a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Steps
#### 1. Get the Data

#### 2. Explore the Data

#### 3. Implement Preprocessing Functions:
* Lookup Table
* Tokenize Punctuation
* Pre-process all the data and save it

#### 4. Build the Neural Network

* Check Access to GPU
* Input Batching
* Test the Dataloader
* Model
* Defining Forward and Backpropagation

#### 5. Neural Network Training

* Train Loop
* Hyperparameters
* Training

#### 6. Generate TV Script

* Generate Text
* Generate a New Script
